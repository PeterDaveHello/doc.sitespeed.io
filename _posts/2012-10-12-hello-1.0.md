# Hello sitespeed.io 1.0
The last couple of months I've been working on a new web performance tool called sitespeed.io. One problem that I want to solve is that all the current tools test one page and gives result about that page. Please let me know more about the whole site :)

Sitespeed.io is built upon the [YSlow](http://www.yslow.org) rule engine and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). It crawls a site and analyze the pages using YSlow rules and new more mobile friendly rules.

You run sitespeed on the command line and it produces the result in a couple of HTML pages.

## The site summary page
The summary page is for your boss. It will take the result of the most important rules and match them with some limits. If the rule is really bad, the result will be red (you need to fix this!), if it is yellow this is something you should look into and if it is green it is perfect.

## Detailed site report
In this view you see the result on a pages level, you can check which page that has the most problem.

## Detailed page report
Here you get the info specific for a a page.

Check out the video to see what you get when you run sitespeed.io:
