# Welcome Firefox and Chrome
I've been working with sitespeed.io for one year now and a lot of things changed. The latest and greatest release combine rules from the web performance best practices with timings fetched from the [Navigation Timing API](https://w3c.github.io/web-performance/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html)! Today we support Chrome and Firefox. We maybe will support IE in the future on Windows.

To fetch the timings, we use [Browsertime](https://github.com/tobli/browsertime), a new project created by me & [Tobias Lidskog](https://twitter.com/tobiaslidskog).
