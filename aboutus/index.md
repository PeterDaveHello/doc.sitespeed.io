# About Us

We are a two member team that works on sitespeed.io in our free time. New contributors and team members are very welcomed!


## Peter Hedenskog
<img src="peter.jpg" class="photo pull-left" width="200" height="200">  I created sitespeed.io late 2012. It's been a lot of work and incredible [fun](http://www.peterhedenskog.com/blog/2015/02/building-a-new-sitespeed.io/)! I'm a web performance geek, love the web and think Open Source is the way forward. At day time, I work at [Cybercom](http://www.cybercom.com/). At night time I work on sitespeed.io.

In early 2015 I was awarded for building sitespeed.io by [The Swedish Internet Infrastructure Foundation](https://www.iis.se/english/about-se/) making it possible for me to work full time on the project for three months.

I'm one of the organizers of the [Stockholm Web Performance meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Web-Performance-Group/). We are 400+ members and are always looking for new speakers. If you are in Stockholm and have something to share, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/soulislove">Twitter</a> and see if we can make it happen.
