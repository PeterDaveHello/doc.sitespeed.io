  <h1>Sitespeed.io 3.1 </h1>
</div>
<p>After releasing 3.0 we felt that there was one big thing that we missed. You could only run when location/browser or use one connectivity per run when we are fetching data from WebPageTest. Sending the data to Graphite, you surely wants to keep track of the metrics for different browsers, the same way you can do it with BrowserTime (running local browsers).</p>

<h2>Run multiple locations of WebPageTest</h2>
<p>You can now test multiple locations/browesers/connectivities for WebPageTest in one and the same run for sitespeed.io. You do that with the <code>wptConfig</code> parameter. If you want to run multiple instances, configure a array with different configurations:
<pre>
[
  {
    "location": "Dulles:Firefox",
    "connectivity": "3G"
  },
  {
    "location": "Dulles:Chrome",
    "connectivity": "Cable"
  }
]
</pre>
Running only one, you can do as before and only configure one configuration object:
<pre>
{
  "location": "Dulles:Firefox",
  "connectivity": "3G"
}
</pre>
Everything will work as before except that the keys in Graphite for WebPageTest will include location, browser and connectivity meaning after you installed the new version you need to go into your grafical interface (Grafana) and change the keys for WebPageTest.
</p>
<h2>Hello slimerjs!</h2>
<p>We cannot tell you have much love we have for PhantomJS! To show it, we also include support for <a href="http://slimerjs.org/">SlimerJS</a> :)  Slimer is not headless but kind of or headlessish. You can now choose which the flag <code>headless</code> which backend to use (PhantomJS is the default one). Another change is that collecting timing metrics using the headless alternative is made by configuring <code>-b headless</code> and will use the backend you configured with the headless flag. Remember: to collect timings using PhantomJS you need the soon coming 2.0 version.
